<p class="about-text">Hey there! I'm Dlovan, a web developer with a growing passion for iOS development. My coding journey started with a simple idea, leading me to explore online resources and university courses.</p>
<p class="about-text">I'm not your typical developer; I'm a problem solver with a creative twist. I see programming as something organic, rather than mechanical, a way to bring ideas to life. Currently, I'm deeply involved in a project aiming to connect people based on their shared interests â€” forming unique digital tribes.</p>
<p class="about-text">Swift and SwiftUI are my languages of choice. The elegance and simplicity of Swift resonate with me, making it my go-to tool for crafting intuitive user experiences.</p>
<p class="about-text">Beyond coding, I find joy in contemplating life's progression and diving into philosophical discussions. Humility and honesty are my guiding principles in both personal and professional pursuits.</p>
<p class="about-text">Let's embark on this coding adventure together and create something extraordinary!</p>
